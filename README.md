# About Project

This API will be created to control the application of vaccines among the Brazilian population, which will have a user registry to receive mandatory data, such as 'name', 'e-mail', 'CPF' and 'date of birth'. You will also have a vaccine application register, receiving the mandatory data, such as the name of the vaccine, the user's email and the date to which it was applied.
